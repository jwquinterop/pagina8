<p style="font-family:arcade Georgia; font-size:20px">  I am a doctoral student in Applied Economics and Management at the University of Pavia and the University of Bergamo. I study problems associated with economic development, focusing on the implications of technology on economic inequalities (education and labor market). My work involves econometrics and field experiments to understand the causal impacts of whether certain technology choices can bring positive outcomes.</p>
